batch mint & burns
===============

this script requires you have the aragonCLI and a HD wallet setup on the network your DAO is on. You can follow [this guide](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragon-cli-setup-guide/1934) to get that set up

## Usage
1. Change `settings.json` data. Set up the DAO, voting and token manager
apps, and the list of addresses you want to mint and burn tokens to.
2. Execute `npm run start` to run the command.
3. On successful, open your DAO and see the new vote.
